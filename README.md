The raw data was in time series. This data is preprocessed by to generate features by collecting a time series signal section and analysing statistical properties of this signal. This signal is fed into neural network. Neural network was not trained properly because of lack of variety in data and also amount of data. But decision tree approach gives 87% accuracy.

merging_and_preprocessing_new file creates a features csv file.
ML_classification.ipynb file is where the algorithms were implemented.
